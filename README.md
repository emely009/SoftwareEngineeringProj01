The project will allow a student to enter their ID, first name, last name, department, major, and email. There is constraints 
where the ID must contain 5 digits, first and last name must be capitalized, and email must be in a string1@string2.com format.
The clear button will clear anything in the text field. The add button will add the students information to the table. The 
delete button will delete a selected row. When a row is selected the information will show up on the text field to allow editing
once satisfied with the changes press the edit button to edit/update table. I tried to get the colora as close as possible.

My only issue with creating the project is that the image(profile picture) will not show up.
